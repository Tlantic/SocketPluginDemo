Where is the platforms folder?
==============================

Basically, its being ignored by .gitignore file. But don't worry. You can rebuild the platforms through cordova cli based in your development environment capabilities:

* cordova build
* cordova build android
* cordova build ios

Use "cordova build" to build all platforms or "cordova build <platform>" in case to build just one of them.
