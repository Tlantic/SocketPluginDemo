Cordova TCP Socket Plugin v0.2.x release notes
==============================================

## v0.2.0

This is the second version of the plugin, with few support to attend basic needs regarding iOS platform.
A lot of issues were fixed, specially about socket closing problems (resources were not being disposed correctly) and a new piece of code was added to "recover" a connection when trying to connect twice on same host/port. Basically, no connection is created and the existing object is being assign to the  "task".

Besides that, both platforms (Android and iOS) return the connection id when calling "connect". The intention is use this id for all operations in the future instead of have your code informing host and port all the time.

Be aware the plugin only works with string objects. If you want to transfer JSON information, you have to handle this using yoru own javascript code.

### Cordova/Phonegap Compatibility

The following versions of Cordova/Phonegap were used to test this plugin:

* Cordova 3.4
* Phonegap 3.4


### Platforms support

Platforms supported by this plugin:

* Android 4.1.1 or later
* iOS 7.x


### Limitations

By now, no limitation was detected but the pause/resume states probably have to be handled in a better way. 
There is no piece of code looking for this behavior. Even knowing the code didn't present any issue with that, it must
be tested.
