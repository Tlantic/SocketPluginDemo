Cordova TCP Socket Plugin v0.1.x release notes
==============================================

## v0.1.0

This is the first version of the plugin, with few support to attend basic needs.

### Cordova/Phonegap Compatibility

The following versions of Cordova/Phonegap were used to test this plugin:

* Cordova 3.4
* Phonegap 3.4


### Platforms support

Platforms supported by this plugin:

* Android 4.1.1 or later


### Limitations

By now, no limitation was detected but the pause/resume states probably have to be handled in a better way. 
There is no piece of code looking for this behavior. Even knowing the code didn't present any issue with that, it must
be tested.
